Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of my public projects and experiments. In my spare time, I love diving into:

- Designing and exploring DSLs and programming languages
- Creating handy CLI utilities
- Developing tools for Knowledge Graphs
- Conducting AI and computer science experiments

Curious about how Knowledge Graphs can benefit your project? Feel free to ask! You can also check out my latest insights and discoveries on my blog, [The Wandering Glitch](https://aabs.wordpress.com). Let's connect and tinker with tech together!
