Hello and welcome!  This little profile page contains some of the public things I have been working on recently.

- Iâ€™m currently completing the next generation of fishdots which now loads really fast and provides tons of useful functionality
- I'm tinkering about with a new little language called Fifth that will make working with RDF a lot easier.
- Ask me about semantic web and how it can help you
- How to reach me: DM me at @aabs ![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/aabs?style=social)
