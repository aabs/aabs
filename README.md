Hello and welcome!  This page contains some of the public things I have been working on.

I spend a lot of my spare time (such as it is...) messing about with: 

- DSLs and Programming languages
- labour saving utilities for Fish shell
- Semantic Web Utilities
- Experiments in AI/Comp Sci

Ask me about Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs to find out how it can help you!
